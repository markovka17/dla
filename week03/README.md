# Week 03

# Automatic Speech Recognition I

### Slides
* [ASR I](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1bgXwt6roTvg1xynNnyzLLOLq4e2wrAV0jHo33xY7aqM/edit?usp=sharing)
    * Automatic speech recognition (ASR)
    * Metrics for ASR
    * CTC loss function
    * "Listen, Attend and Spell" archetecture
    * Beam-search

### Prerequisites

* This lecture assumes you are familiar with the __attention mechanism__. If you're not feeling confident about this
  topic, we recommend that you read one of the following materials:
    * [How Attention works in Deep Learning: understanding the attention mechanism in sequence models](https://theaisummer.com/attention/)
        * Simple language. Easy to understand. Quite detailed. Not too technical. Surface knowledge.
    * [Sequence to Sequence (seq2seq) and Attention](https://lena-voita.github.io/nlp_course/seq2seq_and_attention.html)
        * Nicely illustrated. Detailed math explanations. A bit bulk.

### Practice & homework

* [Seminar 1](./seminar03_1.ipynb) Audio augmentations with code and examples
* [Seminar 2](./seminar03_2.ipynb) Practical excersises
    * Writing and testing WER-metric
    * Implementing CTC decoding
    * Implementing CTC beam-search
* (*bonus!*) Intro to PyCharm
